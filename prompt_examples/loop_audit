Read the .meta_marge/AGENTS.md file and follow it.

Instructions:
- do not audit .meta_marge, but do reference its tasklist and assessment files
- Find an expert for for every audit task in the experts folder
- Audit the new features added and exiting features
- Audit the workspace and compare it to meta assessment and tasklist audit, make sure all actions that would benefit us, were taken. list them here if there are any
- Make sure all actions taken, benefited us
- Audit CLI functions, ensure they match intended functionality. Reference docs as needed.
- When conflicts exist, pick the option that makes the most sense based on what creates a more robust system, not ease of implementation
- bring all supporting documentation up to date. dont change supporting docs in any major way as I like the way they all are atm, simply amedn or lightly eit to bring them up to date/up to par
- Great end user experience and access to funcitonality is the paramount directive

update assessment.md and tasklist.md (etc) as you go

Loop until clean, minimum 20 iterations.

1 loop = ENTIRE audit of the workspace

Output using the Response Format (include IDs created) WITH DETAIL for the user to understand.

Between each loop, fix the issues. Do not stop between loops except for a brief pause. Audit → fix → audit → fix until you hit at least the min stated above, and keep looping beyond the min if there are still issues found until clean.
